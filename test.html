            <p>Photography has always been one of my favorite creative outlets. As a <strong>freelance photographer</strong>, I enjoy capturing natural moments, real emotions, and unique perspectives. My favorite subjects include weddings, portraits, and gym photography—where every image tells a story of dedication and individuality.</p>

            <p>Through photography, I’ve learned the value of observation, patience, and lighting. I strive to make my work feel authentic and personal, combining artistic composition with natural tones. This creative process gives me balance outside of my academic life and allows me to connect with people through art.</p>

            <p>Here are a few of the types of photography I specialize in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>📸 Wedding photography – capturing timeless emotions</li>
                <li>💪 Powerlifting and gym portraits – showcasing strength and focus</li>
