            <p>Hi there! I’m a Northeastern University student studying Marketing and Accounting, with a minor in Data Science. I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of creativity and strategy, understanding not just the numbers behind decisions but also the stories that bring brands and people to life.
Outside the classroom, I’m a freelance photographer with a passion for storytelling. For me, photography is more than just taking pictures; it’s about capturing authentic emotion and preserving the fleeting moments that often go unnoticed. Whether it’s a candid smile, a quiet reflection, or the energy of a crowded street, I aim to tell stories that feel real and human through my lens.
My background in marketing and data science gives me a unique perspective. I love finding the balance between analytical insight and creative expression. I believe that great storytelling, whether through visuals or strategy, comes from understanding people deeply and connecting with them genuinely.
I’m always looking for new opportunities to learn, collaborate, and grow, whether that’s through building brands, exploring data-driven creativity, or sharing the world as I see it through my camera.<p>
